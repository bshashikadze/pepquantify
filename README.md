# pepquantify

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

pepquantify takes the peptide level output of the proteomics dataset and
proposes various options to pre-filter and clean up the data and prepare
for further analysis with an ‘MS-EmpiRe’ package. Also,
‘pepquantify’ can perform missing value imputation with user-defined
settings, to include peptides with a high detection rate in only one
condition, but very low in another, in the quantitative analysis.

## How to install?

You can install the development version of pepquantify from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bshashikadze/pepquantify")
```

Additionally you will need an MS-EmpiRe installed to perform normalization & quantification
https://github.com/zimmerlab/MS-EmpiRe 

## Example script

This is a basic example:
1. set the working directory to the folder which contains proteomics dataset

*pepquantify read functions expect that your working directory contains proteinGroups.txt and peptides.txt (MaxQuant outputs) in case of DDA data (lfq or TMT), and main output of DIA-NN in case of the DIA analysis (to come soon). See also ?read_mqdda and read_diann*

### load the libraries
*Vast majority of pepquantify functions are written using tidyverse package collection, they will be imported automatically*
``` r
library(pepquantify)
library(msEmpiRe)
```


### define the function that performs data loading, normalization and quantification (MS-EmpiRe)
You need to execute this function once only in each session to have it in a global environment  

<details>
<summary>info</summary>

see: https://github.com/zimmerlab/MS-EmpiRe 
note1: this function consists with codes which can be found in -
https://github.com/zimmerlab/MS-EmpiRe/blob/master/example.R 
note2: this is only an example code and for more information you should
refer to the documentation of an MS-EmpiRe package. 
note3: in msEmpiRe::read.standard I usually use <\\.[0-9]*$> istead of '\\.'.
This is necessary to remove unique number at the end of the protein ids which are added by pepquantify read function.  
"\\.[0-9]*$" this pattern removes everything after the last dot (.), while the "\\." removes after the 
first dot, which is inconvinient in case of ncbi refseq protein database which has version numbers e.g. XP_123456.1

``` r
msempire_calculation <- function(data, data2 = data_raw, seed=1234, fc_threshold = 1.5) {
  
  require(magrittr)
  
  # read the data in the expressionset format and perform msempire normalization and quantification  
  # (https://github.com/zimmerlab/MS-EmpiRe/blob/master/example.R)
  
  msempiredata  <- msEmpiRe::read.standard(msempire_data[[1]], msempire_data[[2]],
                                            prot.id.generator = function(pep) unlist(strsplit(pep, "\\.[0-9]*$"))[1],
                                            signal_pattern="Intensity.*")
  
  # msempire calculations
  set.seed(seed = seed)
  msempire_results <- msempiredata  %>%
    msEmpiRe::normalize() %>%
    msEmpiRe::de.ana() %>%
    write.table(paste0(data[[3]], "/msempire_results_raw.txt"), sep = "\t", row.names = F)
  
  # tidy results (pepquantify package)
  pepquantify::resultstidy(data, data2,  fc_threshold = fc_threshold)
}
```

### read the data
*data should be loaded once, while the functions below can be executed as many times as many dual comparisons there are: e.g. cond1 vs cond2, cond1 vs cond3 and etc.*

conditions file will be generated which you should modify according to
experimental conditions. For more information please refer to the function
description (type ?read_mqdda in the R console)

<details>
<summary>Arguments</summary>

* exclude_samples:
if not empty, excludes specified sample/s from further analysis (only if necessary, e.g. after inspecting PCA)

* lfq:
if non-labelled data is loaded, lfq must be set to true, if labelling was performed (e.g. TMT) lfq should be set to false. For TMT **Reporter.intensity.corrected** is taken for quantification
</details> 

*Keep the name as "data_raw", if you change make sure you indicate it in the next function as well (see pepquantify_funs())*
``` r
data_raw <- pepquantify::read_mqdda()
```

### prepare the dataset and perform quantification
<details>
<summary>Arguments</summary>

* data:
list of two containing peptide and protein group data generated by the read functions of the pepquant package (default data_raw)

* imputation:	
if true imputation will be performed if set to false no imputation will be performed (default false)

* n_element_peptide:	
peptide data is the nth element of the list (not necessary to change) (default 1)

* condition1:	
name of the first condition that should be compared (note that order matters for the fold-change direction) 

* condition2:	
name of the second condition that should be compared (note that order matters for the fold-change direction)

* n_condition_1:	
minimum number of the valid values in the first condition (this value should be at least two, but default pepquant value is three)

* n_condition_2:	
minimum number of the valid values in the second condition (this value should be at least two, but default pepquant value is three)

* min_pep:	
minimum number of peptides for each protein (default 2)

* downshift:	
see the perseus documentation "Replace missing values from normal distribution" (default 1.8)

* width:	
see the perseus documentation "Replace missing values from normal distribution" (default 0.3)

* n_ko_like:	
minimum number of peptides that should have missing and valid value pattern (all valid in one condition, maximum 1 in the second, or otherwise by user defined criteria) (default 2)

* fraction_valid:	
between 0-1. 1 means that imputed peptides are taken into account if they are present in all samples of one of the conditions (and max 1 in the second condition, see also option "second_condition"), 0.5 means if they are present in the half of the samples of one of the conditions. (default 1)

* second_condition:	
maximum acceptable number of valid values in other condition when fraction valid is met in the other (default 1)

* seed:	
as values for imputation are derived randomly, seed makes sure the reproducibility (default 1234)

* fc_threshold:
minimum fold change for the protein to be considered differentially abundant (in natural scale) (default 1.5)

</details>
  
*Two function below should be run as many times as many comparisons there are, it will generate specific folder for each comparison, e.g. if condition1 = "disease" and condition2 = "healty", the folder will be generated automatically in the working directory named as disease_vs_healthy. If you have other group e.g. treated, you just copy paste the following two lines and run with e.g. condition1 = "disease", condition2 = "treated" and the folder will be generated named as disease_vs_treated. Also, order matters for the fold-change direction: positive l2fc will be the ones increased in condition1.*

 
``` r
msempire_data <- pepquantify::pepquantify_funs(data_raw, condition1 = "name_of_condition_one", condition2 = "name_of_condition_two")
msempire_calculation(msempire_data, fc_threshold = 1.5)
```  
  
<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

* msempire_results_raw:     
this is the raw results of MS-EmpiRe

* msempire_results_tidy:    
this is the results that has been cleaned-up and can be used for suppl tables

* msempire_results_volcano: 
some columns was adjusted to make it suitable for the volcano plot
